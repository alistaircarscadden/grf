# ac.grf

An OpenTTD NewGRF

### Build

nmlc 0.5 is required.
Python 3 is required, and this build is only tested with 3.8.2.

Run `build.bat` to run the build.
If you do not want the .grf copied automatically into `"%UserProfile%\Documents\OpenTTD\newgrf"` remove that line from the build. Either way, the .grf is generated into `grf/`.
